The first scraping script extracts the product list from the **“La Esperanza”** bakery website, collecting a total of **422 product records**.  
Each record includes basic information such as product name and category, and is later used as the input dataset for the simulation script.

> **Important:**  
> - Make sure you have all the required Python libraries installed before running the scraper.  
> - The **second script (simulation)** depends on the dataset generated by the **first script (scraping)**, so you must run the scraper at least once before executing the simulation.

> **Note on the catalog:**  
> In the online catalog, the **ice cream section** does not provide price information.  
> For the purposes of the simulation and to keep the storyline consistent, reasonable prices are **assumed and assigned programmatically** to those items.
